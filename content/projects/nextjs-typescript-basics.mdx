# Getting Started with Next.js and TypeScript

Next.js is a popular React framework for building web applications. When combined with TypeScript, it provides even more powerful tooling for type safety and code consistency.

In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of setting up a Next.js project with TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Creating a Next.js Project

To create a new Next.js project, run the following command:

npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app --typescript

This command will scaffold a new Next.js project with TypeScript support.

## Adding TypeScript Support

Next.js already comes with built-in TypeScript support, so you don't need to do much to get started. TypeScript configuration files (`tsconfig.json`) are already set up for you.

## Creating Pages

In Next.js, pages are created in the `pages` directory. Each file in this directory represents a route in your application.

Create a new file `pages/index.tsx` with the following content:

This file represents the homepage of your application.

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

npm run dev

This will start the Next.js development server and you can access your application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set up a Next.js project with TypeScript. You can now start building your application with the power of Next.js and TypeScript.

Happy coding
