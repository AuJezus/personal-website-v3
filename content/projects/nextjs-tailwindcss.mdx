Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build responsive and customizable user interfaces with ease. When combined with Next.js, you can create powerful web applications with minimal effort.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use Tailwind CSS with Next.js to create responsive UIs.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Setting Up a Next.js Project

If you haven't already, create a new Next.js project by running the following command:

npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app

Navigate to your project directory and install Tailwind CSS:

npm install tailwindcss

Next, generate a Tailwind CSS configuration file:

npx tailwindcss init

## Configuring Tailwind CSS

In your project directory, create a `tailwind.config.js` file with the following content:

This configuration file tells Tailwind CSS to purge unused styles in production and extends the default theme.

## Importing Tailwind CSS

To use Tailwind CSS in your Next.js project, import it into your `styles/globals.css` file:

@import 'tailwindcss/base';
@import 'tailwindcss/components';
@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';

This will import Tailwind CSS styles and apply them to your entire application.

## Creating a Responsive Layout

Now that we have Tailwind CSS set up, let's create a responsive layout for our application.

```jsx
// components/Layout.js
import React from "react";

const Layout = ({ children }) => {
  return <div className="container mx-auto">{children}</div>;
};

export default Layout;
```

This layout component centers the content horizontally on the page.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've learned how to integrate Tailwind CSS into a Next.js project to build responsive UIs. With Tailwind CSS's utility classes, you can create beautiful and responsive designs with minimal CSS code.

Happy coding!
