A simple, pink themed one pager site for my girlfriend's tutoring work. It shares key info and
links to a Google Form for registration.

- Clear layout and easy-to-read content
- Mobile-friendly
- AI generated illustrations (maybe in the future will change to real images).

There are plans in the near future to add some animations using [motion](https://motion.dev/).

Tech: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.
